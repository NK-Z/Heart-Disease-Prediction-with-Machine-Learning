# Heart-Disease-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia) and heart defects youâ€™re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.

in this project we will apply machine learning techniques to classify if this person has hart disases or not ( 0 or 1 ) .
